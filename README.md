# AdoptMe! Client App

AdoptMe! is a first come first serve pet adoptation app. Users create an account which includes their zipcode and nearby cats and dogs are populated that are in need of a good home. Adoptation listings are pulled from the PetFinder Api. Users are only able to select either the next up cat or dog... no browsing of aniamls!
